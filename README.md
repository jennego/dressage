# Dressage Tests API / Admin Backend

Current to-do

Rails

- Upgrade to Rails 6 - yes
- figure what happened to my users/sessions - autogenerated with devise, figure out use with devise in API
- JWT-devise?
- OAuth - figure out how to add it to the api (not just to the rails app or the SPA that is not linked to the backend)
- GraphQL?
- Eventually change to serve admin functions only
- Remove unneeded stuff
- Fix seeds for spelling and accuracy errors
- Last thing: Add Second/Third/Fourth Level, FEI tests

New features (both)

- Add User and Admin roles
- Users can favorite tests, set settings (theme, arena size)
- Admin can do all users can do, plus add and edit tests

All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future.
Other tests (eventing, working equitation, FEI, para-equestrian) may be added on request or as time permits.

For non-equestrians: Dressage is an equestrian sport and is with the exception of freestyle is a fixed set of patterns called 'tests'.

Don't go around studying the wrong test!!

This app runs on Ruby on Rails with postgreSQL.

EC/USEF tests only for now. Others may be added on request as well (send them to me and let me know where to find them!)
