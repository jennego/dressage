# Dressage Tests

A mobile-friendly dressage test directory. All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future. Dressage is an equestrian sport and is with the exception of freestyle is a fixed set of patterns called 'tests'.

Don't go around studying the wrong test

Ruby on Rails with postgresql.

EC/USEF tests only for now. Others may be added on request as well (send them to me and let me know where to find them!)

To do

- add data (dressage tests) - several more seeds still need to be created
- create api - TO DO
- add association to similar tests  - TO DO - one test to many lists of tests? Or search? Or filter?
- figure out how to group by level and display only current tests on index
- figure out auto complete (low priority - maybe wait for SPA?)
- try filterific? - in progress with little success

TO DO 
Add submit button to filter
Add filter by Level, Year, Org_Name
