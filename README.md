# Dressage Tests


https://dressage-tests.herokuapp.com/
2019 training and first level now deployed!

A mobile-friendly dressage test directory. Wondering what your test is? Last minute look up? No time to print? Easily view your test from your phone or tablet! 

All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future. 
Other tests (eventing, working equitation, FEI, para-equestrian) may be added on request or as time permits.

For non-equestrians: Dressage is an equestrian sport and is with the exception of freestyle is a fixed set of patterns called 'tests'.

Don't go around studying the wrong test!!

This app runs on Ruby on Rails with postgreSQL, using bootstrap and filterific. 

EC/USEF tests only for now. Others may be added on request as well (send them to me and let me know where to find them!)
