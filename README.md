# Dressage Tests

https://dressage-tests.herokuapp.com/

Curently has EC walk/trot and EC/USEF training level tests only. 

A mobile-friendly dressage test directory. All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future. Dressage is an equestrian sport and is with the exception of freestyle is a fixed set of patterns called 'tests'.

Don't go around studying the wrong test

This app is Ruby on Rails with postgresql, using bootstrap and filterific. 

EC/USEF tests only for now. Others may be added on request as well (send them to me and let me know where to find them!)

To do

- add data (dressage tests) - several more seeds still need to be created
- Test and secure api
- figure out auto complete (low priority - maybe wait for SPA?)s
- Add filter by Year, Org_Name (add function to do it)
- Seed tests 1-4 level
- Add current - true/false to filter and show pages
