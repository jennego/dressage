# Dressage Tests

https://dressage-tests.herokuapp.com/

Currently has EC walk/trot and EC/USEF training level tests only. 

A mobile-friendly dressage test directory. All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future. Dressage is an equestrian sport and is with the exception of freestyle is a fixed set of patterns called 'tests'.

Don't go around studying the wrong test!!

This app runs on Ruby on Rails with postgreSQL, using bootstrap and filterific. 

EC/USEF tests only for now. Others may be added on request as well (send them to me and let me know where to find them!)

To do

- fix sql security issues - look into active record queries 
- Test and secure api
- figure out auto complete (low priority - maybe wait for SPA?)s
- Seed tests 1-4 level
- upload files in seeds?
- link current versions of tests to old tests?
- edit forms 
- show arena figures on click or hover 
- save arena size
- show radio for current filter 
- click on row? (javascript)
