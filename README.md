- Connect User to Auth0 user and to fav test model
- All admins can edit tests - list last edit
- Drafts for tests?
- Remove unneeded stuff
- Fix seeds for spelling and accuracy errors
- Last thing: Add Second/Third/Fourth Level, FEI tests

New features (both)

- Add User and Admin roles (admin yes, no role is user role)
- Users can favorite tests, set settings (theme, arena size)
- Admin can do all users can do, plus add and edit tests

All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future.
Other tests (eventing, working equitation, FEI, para-equestrian) may be added on request or as time permits.

For non-equestrians: Dressage is an equestrian sport and is with the exception of freestyle is a fixed set of patterns called 'tests'.

Don't go around studying the wrong test!!

This app runs on Ruby on Rails with postgreSQL.

EC/USEF tests only for now. Others may be added on request as well (send them to me and let me know where to find them!)
