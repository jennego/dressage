# Dressage Tests

A mobile-friendly dressage test directory. All tests copyright of their respective copyright holders.
Mobile app planned for future. Dressage is an equestrian sport.

Ruby on Rails with postgresql.

EC/USEF tests only for now.

To do

- add data (dressage tests) - several more seeds still need to be created
- create api - TO DO
- add association to similar tests  - TO DO - one test to many lists of tests? Or search?
- figure out how to group by level and display only current tests on index
- figure out auto complete (low priority - maybe wait for SPA?)
- add edit action
- add destroy action
